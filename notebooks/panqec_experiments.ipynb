    "## Summary: How to Apply Logical Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Symplectic Format**: States are represented as length-`2n` vectors where:\n",
    "   - Elements `[0:n]` = X errors/operations on physical qubits\n",
    "   - Elements `[n:2n]` = Z errors/operations on physical qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logical Operators**: Access via `code.logicals_x` and `code.logicals_z`\n",
    "   - Shape: `(k, 2n)` where `k` = number of logical qubits\n",
    "   - Each row is a logical operator in binary symplectic format\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applying Gates**: Use modulo-2 addition\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   new_state = (old_state + logical_operator) % 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Physical Gate Application**: \n",
    "   - For X gate on qubit i: flip bit at index `i`\n",
    "   - For Z gate on qubit i: flip bit at index `n+i`\n",
    "   - For Y gate on qubit i: flip both bits\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Checking State**:\n",
    "   - `code.logical_errors(state)` - returns length-`2k` array showing which logical operators anticommute\n",
    "   - `code.in_codespace(state)` - True if syndrome is zero\n",
    "   - `code.is_logical_error(state)` - True if any logical operator anticommutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1. Initialize state (e.g., `np.zeros(2*code.n)` for |0...0⟩)\n",
    "2. Apply logical gates by adding logical operators\n",
    "3. Add noise if simulating errors\n",
    "4. Measure syndrome and decode\n",
    "5. Check if logical state preserved"
